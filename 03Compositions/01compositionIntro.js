 
// Composition in JavaScript is a pattern that promotes building complex behaviors by combining smaller, reusable functions or objects rather than relying on inheritance. It's a fundamental principle in functional programming and is often used to create flexible, modular, and testable code.

//supppose there is a class having methods a,b,c and class2 extends class1 and have methods d and other class3 also extends class1 have methods e , now we want a class having properties a,b,c,d,e then it is not possible to extend class1,2,3 at a time. so here requirement of composition arises.
